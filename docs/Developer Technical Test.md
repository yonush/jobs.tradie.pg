# Developer Technical Test

This exercise is an opportunity for you to create some working software and present it to a
technical team for review. It is expected that it will take 1-3 hours to complete the challenge. We
will let you know when we require the exercise to be completed - normally within 5 days.

## Requirements

You are required to provide an application that allows a tradie to see their jobs.
Jobs have the following information associated with them:

- Unique job identifier.
- Status: one of "scheduled", "active", "invoicing", “to priced” or “completed”.
- Creation date and time.
- General information like name and contact details of the client.

The tradie can also make notes for each job. A job can have any number of notes associated with
them.

The tradie should be able to:
- Filter and sort the list of jobs.
- Click on a job in the list to view their details and add/edit notes for that job.
- Change the status of a job.

Notes
1. Construct one part of the application (either font-end or back-end)
1. You may use any programming languages, data store and frameworks you want.
1. Think about all of the supporting code you may need for a professionally built application.

## Submission

In order for us to assess your work:
- Upload your project to a public GitHub repository
- Include a readme.md to allow another developer to quickly orient themselves to your solution without needing to talk to you directly.
- Respond to us with the name of the GitHub repository
